# GAMELIB_OUT=android/out/<version>), its game code copied into the app's internal storage, since Android loads no code
# from external storage, and both handed to the runtime (LARECOMP_DATA_ROOT, LARECOMP_GAME_LIB). Saves and settings live
# in that data root too; with none there yet, the runtime starts the save as a copy of v1.0.0's (LARECOMP_SAVE_SEED).
